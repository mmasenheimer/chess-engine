# A multithreaded chess engine built with Python and Pygame, featuring a full ruleset implementation, move validation, and an AI opponent powered by the NegaMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

**Currently working on packaging it up and hosting on itch.io

Hit "r" for board reset and hit "z" to undo the previous move!

To set the AI/Human players, navigate to Chess > ChessMain.py and set the Player one or player two variables = true or false depending on if you want a human playing or an ai playing, respectively.
For the level of the AI, navigate to Chess > moveFinder > and set the depth to levels 1-4. (Note with depths higher than 4, the algorithm will take substantially longer to process moves).

# Installation:
