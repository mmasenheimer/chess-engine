A multithreaded chess engine built with Python and Pygame, featuring a full ruleset implementation, move validation, and an AI opponent powered by the NegaMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

**Currently working on packaging it up and hosting on itch.io

To set the AI level, navigate Chess > ChessMain.py and set the Player one or player two variables = true or false depending on if you want a human playing or an ai playing, respectively.
